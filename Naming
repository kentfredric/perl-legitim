Proposed names:

  LIVINGWILL
    pro: Sorts close to (after) LICENSE
    pro: Mostly clear description of purpose
    con: Unwieldy name due to implied but absent space
    con: Name not "serious sounding" and is prone to being overlooked
    con: Name not a "unique token" and is thus a "descriptor of content" as
         opposed to a recognizeable "label for content"

  LEGITIM
    pro: Sorts close to (before) LICENSE
    pro: Legal term closely associated with inheritance of property
    pro: Latin word
    pro: "Serious sounding" and is hopefully prone to drawing attention
    pro: Unique token and will quickly communciate intent once awareness of the
         word builds.
    con: Opaque to people who don't have foreknowledge of the term
